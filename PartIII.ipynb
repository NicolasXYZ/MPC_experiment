    "Mundell’s redundancy (or \"n-1\") problem illustrates how international finance can be interpreted by some as a zero-sum game, with many prisoners dilemma problems. Such a view logically leads some countries to **try to \"game\" the international monetary system**, first and foremost through their managed floating currencies (hence the vocabulary around \"manipulation\" on what concerns exchange rate levels).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, since the dollar unpegged from gold and some currencies started to float, exchange rate manipulation has been tolerated up to some point - principally because of the increased difficulty in pinpointing exactly what the \"fair\" parity between the two legs of a currency pair would be, which itself would influence in return all other currency pairs these two legs are involved in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"fair exchange rate levels\" itself changed meaning, between a Gold Standard world in which the anchor aimed at adjusting (im-)balances of payments, and a free floating world \"in a global liquidity trap, in which the exchange rate affects the *distribution* of recessions across countries\" (Caballero, Farhi, Gourinchas, 2017).\n",

    "Here we provide a model and simulations in an interactive Notebook format to load and play directly with the Matlab code **to examine how international monetary systems relying on specified nominal anchors (silver and gold, sterling then USD, bancor sometimes maybe)** - though the most \"natural\" form of anchoring, as it provides a solution to commitment and reneging issues - **create incentives that might be correlated with hegemonic wars** *(political scientists - Wallerstein, Modelski, Organski or more recently Goldstein - have long explored these cycles, but economists also advanced some causal hypothesis. Vilfredo Pareto in his \"Forme di fenomeni economici e previsioni\" for instance postulated that ascending and descending phases in international trade are linked to more or less available saving levels, and that period of social unrest and cross-country wars occur in such descending phases)*.\n",

For instance the Victorian age UK, the gilded age US, and now the post-economic opening China. And, within a cycle, the eroding of the elite's \"productivity capture\" due to rising inequaity, rising intra-elite competition, etc has put down in complex dynamic systems format by Peter Turchin.

Indeed, the theoretical advancements on exchange rate determination now put the emphasis on market frictions caused by the few risk-bearing financial intermediaries' shifting perceptions and acceptance of currency risks, whose multi-currency balance sheets readjustments thus constitutes \"first-order determinants of exchange rates and their volatility\" (Gabaix, Maggiori 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if Gabaix and Maggiori (2014)'s main bearers of the risks resulting from international imbalances are the \"highly concentrated, few large financial players ranging from the [former] proprietary desks and investment management arms of global investment banks to macro and currency hedge funds, active investment managers and pension funds\", empirical data show evidence that these actors are only bearing the *marginal* currency risks, while central banks are bearer \"to the first order of approximation of all net foreign demand for 'safe' US assets from 1990 to 2014\" - (see figure 1 below from cfr, February 16, 2018, echoed by Alessandro Dovis discussing GaMa models at the NBER Monetary Economics Meeting of March 7, 2014).\n",

With consequences such as flash crashes - resulting first from very short span imbalances in order books (see figure 2 below from the Bank Of England's Staff Working Paper No. 687, October 2017). \n",

Frankel (2019) illustrates for instance how most central banks are guided by internal *systematic* (systematic floating, or \"dirty\" floating) rules concerning such trade-offs, and how reserve management objectives can be an important term in the equation. The level of exchange rate volatility can then be viewed as determined by the policy trade off of how much of these shocks are to be absorbed into central banks reserves, and how much are let into exchange rate fluctuations.\n",

    "### Mechanism design concerns :\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first observe that the original Bogolmonaia and Moulin's good assignment game mainly concerns itself mainly with **what axiomatic properties such a game has**. Notably that it is **ordinally efficient, fair** (i.e. if everyone prefers his or her assignment to the assignment of anyone else with respect to the reported preferences) ***equal treatment of equals*, but not strategy proof** (i.e. agents might try to manipulate the game - for instance if too many people like the second choice of an agent as their first choice, then this agent may be better off if he starts eating from his second choice instead of his first choice). Furthermore, they proved that **there is no mechanism that satisfies ordinal efficiency, strategy-proofness and equal treatment of equals**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What do these imply for our adaptation in monetary anchoring ?** Let's first note how the entire language around ***\"manipulating one's exchange rate\"*** hints at such market design considerations. Indeed, if one combines a non strategy proof mechanism with the long-term incentives of a repeated game based on this mechanism leading to a \"winner takes all\" reserve currency (and economy), then any agent will have incentives to try to manipulate the game to try to be better off in the resulting distribution (and become closer for instance to being a \"world's banker\", cf Despres, Kindleberger and Salant 1966).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, NB : Bogolmonaia and Moulin's scheme's ordinal efficiency is not that important in our case, since there are secondary markets on which countries' debts can be acquired at any points in time - even though potentially at a higher price. What Bogolmonaia and Moulin's model was used to highlight was indeed rather to decide which countries' debts will NOT be fully endorsed by the end of a round. And since this is the only case incurring a \"penalty\" to countries in our model, let's examine what factor can play there (hence which levers of \"manipulation\" countries have).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "### Collectively preparing a new Bretton Woods :\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also note here that it is the approach we are following so far that is of interest - the specific model and incentives analysis indeed might change in the future, but hopefully many bright minds from market design and contract theory will contribute in examining the monetary anchoring supergame, so that the world comes ready when a new Bretton Woods will be called, and that the contingencies at that time do not dictate its outcomes. After all, **“there is, in particular, all the difference between deliberately creating a system within which competition will work as beneficially as possible and passively accepting institutions as they are”** (Hayek, The Road to Serfdom)\n",
    "So where are the \"tension points\" in our game ? Let's first note where a country can intervene (the size of the cake it issues at the beginning of each round, its interest rates, its eating speed during each round, and its preference ranking), and where it can not (the same parameters for every other countries, plus inflation rates for all countries). Then where privacy intervenes - the cake sizes and eating speeds are known by all at the start of a round, but each country's ranking lists remains in practice private (so in our game the sizes of the cakes issued at the beginning of each round do not factor in the potential rankings). Let's recall there the application of the literature on optimal borrowing lending - and how privacy-preserving technologies can now allow implementations of some schemes designed in the 80s (Townsend 1982, and how technology lowered the cost so became interesting enough to use these more complicated form of contracts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then how do countries potentially improve their lot through interactions with other countries (one could call that manipulating the game - though what I mean here is more on how to interact with other countries so that in the same rules of the same game your outcome improves) ? It has to deal with the private information part of the game, since if known then a country could just adapt its own parameters accordingly (for instance if known all what other countries will eat, with what speed and in what time, one could know until what cake size he'll be able to issue successfully this round). \n",
    "\n",
    "Also looking in more details in how these eating order ranking done by each country is made - we can note that trade partnerships at least intervenes in most of the different modeling of how the ranking is done (one could also imagine military alliances, size of countries' economies...). And what is the best way to gain more trading partners ? By producing more goods, of better quality, or cheaper. So we can relate here this fact from the \"exchange rate manipulation\" language noted earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, a better monetary anchoring game for us will consist in both giving better information to each country about the aggregate other countries' private rankings, so that it can better decide on the size of the cake/debt it issues at a given round/quarter, all the while ensuring that competitive devaluations are avoided. So any optimal monetary anchoring scheme has then to be both an exchange rate stabilization scheme (that still allows to allow for exchange rates to help mitigate unforecasted shocks, and to account for cultural differences among countries - as some exporting countries might agree to finance more importing countries) and a privacy-preserving demand aggregation scheme. And this on a multilateral scheme rather than on networks of bilateral trading partners - as for us only a truly flexible reserve composition and global governance and negotiation platform can lead countries to compete fully on economic terms with less incentive to wage war.\n",

Different values of the nominal exchange rate correspond to different values of the real exchange rate, and therefore to different levels of output and the current account across countries. This mechanism means that, via expenditure switching effects, the exchange rate affects the distribution of recessions across countries in a global liquidity trap. This creates fertile grounds for zerosum beggar-thy-neighbor devaluations achieved by direct interventions in exchange rate markets, stimulating output and improving the current account in one country at the expense of the others.\n",

    "So to stabilise the exchange rates, in our game theoretic cake-eating model, at the core of our proposal resides the *multi-currency* nature of the market making activity of international banks, which we aim at replicating at a central bank level. A first underlying reason would be that of *collection of risk* - in the line of bigger risks for higher returns. Additionally (and that is a second reason for emphasizing the multi-currency aspect) in our case the additional risk is that of adding on more exotic currencies such as the South East Asian ones in a reserve basket previously not containing them - that could thus act as an additional cushion to mitigate external shock on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is then possible to see that for such a **multi-currency reserve balance sheet** the profit objective of traditional private market maker is here also aligned with the volatility stabilization objective of the central banks involved, and that the mechanisms underlying these forms of interventions would be conceptually the same as the ones through which financiers' alterations to their balance sheets affect both the level and volatility of exchange rates.\n",

    "The design question then, critical to the feasibility of such a multi-currencies account for instance, is on **how to create and foster this form of collaboration among different central banks**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Privacy-preserving methods like multiparty computation *(referring to the financial adaptation of Abbe, Khandani, Lo, 2012, which build on Yao 1982; Goldreich, Micali, and Wigderson 1987; Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and Wigderson 1988; Chaum, Crépeau, and Damgard 1988; Beaver, Micali, and Rogaway\n",
    "1990; Cramer et al. 1999)* provide a clear and useful framework on which to **reach agreement on the different exchange and interest rate objectives pursued by respective central banks**. This is why this section will build on the language and framework of these privacy-preserving methods - which again don't have to be *actually* implemented for the interventions to be conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Thus central banks would first each allocate some funds denominated in their national currencies, plus portions of their reserves in each of the currencies they would like to stabilize their exchange rates with. \n",
    "2. They would then set-up the daily volatility bands they want their national currencies to stay in, which proportion of reserves they are ready to commit to the operation, and what amount of risk or leverage they are ready to bear on any derivative instrument used in the process (for convenience let's imagine the updates are only feasible at a regular interval - for instance once a day or once a week. We are then in a discreet time setting). These three points are where privacy-preserving methods might be applied, since participant central banks wouldn't want for instance *the entirety* of the reserves they engaged in that fund to be potentially used to defend the currency of another participating country)\n",
    "3. Thus a daily total amount of reserves committed to each currency could be computed using the aforementioned methods, without individual inputs from each central bank being revealed). Note that the viewing of the results of these computations can also be restrained so that each central bank only sees the pooling of reserves allocated to him - and not that allocated to others. In this fashion, both inputs and outputs of these forms of computations have modular privacy settings, that can be deployed according to participants preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous paragraph described mostly a pooling of reserves, quite similar to what already exists in the Chiang Mai Initiative, but **applied on a continuous and systematic basis rather than just during times of extreme stress** (in fact one of the goals of this automatic and systematic market smoothing is to potentially provide in-commensurable psychological relief and precious time for governments to *avoid* times of extreme stress). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also **other benefits to having a common multicurrency account: first, the mechanisms derived to stabilize a currency vs the international currencies part of the reserves portfolio can now also be used to also stabilize more exotic currency pairs** (but among natural trading partners) such as the MYR/IDR. \n",

    "The automatic smoothing of exchange rate volatility derived in our protocol provides a safety net against currency crashes, without introducing the moral hazard of a fully specified guarantee (since other participants can withdraw their support to the smoothing at the next time allowing update of their preferences). Indeed,” people infer estimates of changes in ’fuzzy’ lifetime incomes from perceptions of the sustainability of current spending rather than, as in conventional economic models, the other way round.” (Mervyn King.

    "\t2. Including more currencies in central bank safe asset reserves\n",
    "    \n",
    "A first observation concerning the ”safe asset shortage” and related to how I propose to strengthen the existing monetary system through application of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation is to link that shortage to the existing literature on information asymmetry. Indeed, if I assume for now for simplicity (the condition will be relaxed in the following paragraph) that all exchange rates are fixed, so that any adjustment of their parities would come unilateral decision from one of the involved parties, then the safest decision for any of the players would be to convert whatever savings they have into a historical, already implemented, safe asset - the USD - even though its return would be lower than holdings in other currencies. Furthermore, this individual rational optimization taken collectively leads to even lower world interest rates, further diminishing returns on reserves denominated in USD.\n",
    "One could for instance derive a small adaptation of a Nash Demand Game, in discreet time, two agents, with each player i potentially devaluating following its arbitrary probability $D_i$ at each time step t - which would give him a one time gain of $d_it$, before the other player also devalue at the following time step t+1, bringing back equilibria. Further assume that there is a total final gain of $G_0$ to be shared between the two players at the end of the game, that decreases to $G_t$ every time any of the agents devalues. Under full private information with none of the players disclosing its probability to devalue $D_i$ at each time step t, then if the total duration T of the game is long enough so that T times (what the player i believes the other player j's behaviour  $D_j*d_jt$ will be) $>$ (the final gain $G_0$), then the rational behaviour of the agent i not knowing agent j's parameters to entirely discard the final gain of $G_0$ and devalues whenever it should deem necessary. Now extending this simple model to N players then reveals that none of these N players will adapt the currency of any other players in this game as a reserve safe asset, since it will fear - justifiably - a devaluation that will reduce the value of its savings in this currency. Revealing some information on the probability to devalue $D_i$ , (or at least, on the average, or the uppermost value of all the $D_i$) will, on the other hand, set a upper bound on the belief from any player i on what the parameters of the other players are. Revealing information about $D_i$*$d_i$ at any time step t can also enable the \"optimal single period borrowing and lending contract\" as described in Townsend (1982), to protect the final gain of $G_0$ from a temporary need for one of the players that another could potentially solve. Implementing these borrowing and lending contracts also further reduces the probability of devaluating from all players, thus increases the chance of their currencies attaining a central bank reserve status (especially if the borrowing and lending contract enforces some swap between the two legs of a currency pair, as described in our protocol previously). The final remark here will concern the relaxation of the fixed exchange rate regime assumption - indeed, the deterministic probabilities to devalue $D_i$ in the previous simple model then become truly uncontrolled probability probabilities $D_it$ resulting from, we have seen in section I, shifts in risk appetite from all the private financial intermediaries bearing the risks of the immediate imbalances in international flows. This additional uncertainty weights further on the left hand term of the inequality on (what the player i believes markets will inflict to the player j's exchange rate $D_jt$), resulting in non-cooperative behaviours. Thus we further advocate here the implementation of currency intervention agreements - not just from a trade or safety net point of view now, but also to contribute to balancing the asymmetry in the current dollar-centric system, by internationalizing more currencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s note that our proposed framework would also further extend the existing institutional (or rather non-instutionalized) framework through which current-account surplus countries finance current-account deficit countries. By adapting the previous model we could also argue here that any framework that would lead to more explicit forms of external constraints for deficit countries (if surplus countries want to stop accumulating one specific currency they can just lower the proportion from their own reserve committed to help stabilize that currency) would also increase the long-term gains of all the parties involved - including that of the country currently in a temporary current-account deficit.\n",

A mechanism for each participating country to harmonize the exchange rate volatility considerations above and interest rate policies has then, and can, be derived using the same privacy preserving methodology. This harmonization process consists indeed for each participating country to specify privately its interest rate targets on its own currency-denominated bonds, and to specify its returns targets on each of the other participating currencies. The ”planner” can then solve this optimization problem, without any of the participant accessing others’ preferences, and distribute the amount of each currency to be held by each central bank to the closest of its preference.\n",
    "Let’s note that introducing the above protocol for each maturity of each currency- denominated bond can also provide central banks with an additional tool to influence the yield curve - for instance by setting the interest rate target 30 year bonds higher (respectively, lower) than the average return target of the other central banks to lead them to buy (respectively sell) bonds at these maturities; similarly with 10 year bonds then, and 7 year bonds after, etc.\n",

But no single country seemed able to achieve that. Each central bank acting on its own was faced with the invidious choice between raising interest rates sufficiently to dampen the level of domestic demand, knowing that the likely result would be a recession at home, and continuing on a path that would in the end prove unsustainable and lead to an even bigger recession.” Thus he wonders - ”Were there other policy instruments, unavailable to central banks, which might have resolved those coordination problems, and would they contribute to the healing process today? Or are we headed for another crisis?” (p332-333) The protocol I explicated in this paper can also include a privacy-preserving computation at each update time t for central banks’ desired targets at t+1, for them to coordinate among themselves without revealing any private preference or target.\n",

However, the new theories, practices and technologies are now allowing adjustments in real-time of exchange rates and their volatility bands (potentially under privacy-preserving methods), i.e. less incentives for speculation and more flexibility to defend against attacks. Furthermore, the common pooling and commitment of reserves - once again adjusted in real-time - offers a discreet form of fiscal control tied to the usage of the pooled reserves, that was and is still lacking on the Euro- pean side. Thus, rather than ”crossing the river in one leap”, we are here offering additional ”stones in the river” to be tested and relied upon, after the failure of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism also buried the discussions on a common currency for the ASEAN.\n",

    "Another Chinese idiom emphasizes that while ”the sea of bitterness ahead has no bounds, turning back one can still see the shore”. In fact, should the eurozone’s citizens find the constraints of the necessary political union too binding, the mechanisms laid out here offer a new and smoother transition path out of the single currency. Furthermore, if I consider the parallel discussions on central bank digital euros, along with all the additional markers or interest differential they would be capable of bearing, a symbolic unique Euro could still be preserved among European consumers, while a marker on the digital token specifying whether that token is a French digital Euro, a German digital Euro or a Spanish digital Euro would allow different nationalities’ tokens to be exchanged at different exchange rates on global FX markets. That setting would thus correspond to a system with different European currencies and monetary policies, but with each of the European government subsidizing intra-Eurozone cross-border consumer spending to preserve the symbol of an unique currency. Accordingly, a French person traveling to Germany could then just spend his French-Euros on German-Euro labelled hostels, food and entertainment, as if they were the same, with the clearing system automatically billing the Banque de France (or the Bundesbank) and compensating the German sellers (or vice versa) of the exchange rate differentials. The underlying transfers between the respective central banks could here again be implemented following the mechanism described in this paper, to guarantee smooth exchange rate fluctuations and constantly adjusted agreement on the sharing of imbalances and reserves. The specific sectors for which currency parities are maintained through subsidies can be decided and adjusted through time, as the current unique currency acts as if governments are subsidizing all sectors of the economy to maintain parity. A gradual path out of the Euro could thus involve gradually removing these subsidies across more and more sectors.\n",

    "\tPareto improvement of the existing monetary system\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the argumentation in the previous paragraph, I can emphasize here that implementing the proposed protocols on top of the existing monetary system only adds positive features - the smoothing of exchange rate volatility and coordination of interest rates (see below) - to the current zero cooperation situation. In fact, under the proposed protocol, countries eventually deciding to stop cooperating with others just return to the current non intervention in exchange rate practice. Thus, if the cost in terms of reserves (the only costs in the proposed protocol) are rightfully shared between the two participants of a currency pairs, and potentially compensated through mutual swap agreements, then the protocol de- livers a net improvement in the stability of participating currencies and monetary policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "One could argue that a country which would wish to exit this protocol after potentially accumulating under it foreign liabilities, could be in the position to seriously disrupt these foreign currencies by massively using the reserves at its disposal (one of the fears to- day concerning China holding massive US debts). To this I would first argue that the transition from the current situation, in which a few countries have been piling up reserves in just three or four ”safe” currencies, to a multilateral version in which all participating countries are exchanging reserves denominated in currencies from all of each other, would considerably reduce the aforementioned risk. Second, the smoothing and safety net engaged (potentially through financial options - which mark strong commitment) around currencies still remaining in the protocol should contribute in mitigating them from the impact of the unloading of their currencies by the exiting country. The same argument - that all other countries could also unload their reserves denominated in the currency of the country leaving the protocol - should also contribute in holding the multilateral protocol together, so that all transitions happen within the consensus bandwidths (which are regularly adjusted for each currency pair) and the shocks (including resulting from these readjustments) can be smooth and controlled.\n",

    " I use the simulations described in https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NicolasXYZ/MPC_experiment/blob/master/SASvFinancialCycles.ipynb?flush_cache=true, and implemented in https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NicolasXYZ/MPC_experiment/master?filepath=second_notebook.ipynb. There, one can run the exact coding to see the current results, and modify the code at will to test out new ideas.\n",

    "These simulations of extra Covid debts show that :\n",
    "- in the case of everything constant (pre Trump US and China trade relations) debts are overall sustainable, with adjustments in reserve levels and contraction of countries’ economies depending on how affected by the crisis they were.\n",
    "- similar results in the case of everything constant, with just additional reliance on trade with China (for instance for masks, medical supplies etc). The economic contraction is smaller, and the global reserve contraction as well. This could be interpreted by the fact that the additional trade with China is flushed in its reserve (the increase can be seen in the graph below), used to acquire other countries’ debt (inferred from the lowering of global interest rates) and thus sustaining economic activity\n",
    "- in the case of everything constant among all countries except China and US, who in that scenario stop trading with each other, they are small probabilities of a global contraction (less reserves, less debts, less GDP growth) that preserves the overall shares of each country in the global economy - except for China in the global economy which suffers more. However in these small probability event the US go through an initial bubble fueled by the decrease of China, that then collapses back to the initial level (and note that after this collapse China’s share is also back to the initial level - but with the cost of a global contraction, especially for all EM markets). And with the caveat provided just above that this debt model doesn’t take into account other incentives and consequences created by such dynamics - small probabilities in economic contraction in one country might leading to escalating tensions on other dimensions as well\n",
    "- in the case of stopping trade between China and the US AND additional reliance by other countries on China, there is high probability for a sudden takeover of the role of the US as reserve currency China, accompanied by strong contraction for every other country. Again, with the previous caveat of unaccounted destabilizing geopolitical consequences.\n",
    "- finally, in the case of our proposed stabilization scheme the effects of all above scenarii are smoothen, with much more balanced reserve currencies (at least 3 currencies accounting each more than 20% of the global share of reserves, with the exact currencies - most often Germany ie the Euro, or the JPY - switching depending on the random shocks, but without adverse effects on all countries - including on the US even though the dollar loses its monopoly as reserve currency).\n",

    "\n",
    " I presented here the benefits and implementability of multi-currency balance sheets among different central banks or institutions, that can reduce volatility independently from inflation targeting measures. I further explored how these forms of cooperation could be derived from existing institutions and technologies, and how they would affect the current international monetary system. It is our hope that this article could provide the basis for discussions that would extend and filter the numerous calls and proposals for reforms of the IMF, linking them to the existing technological and political possibilities of our time.\n"
