    "We present here a **dynamic and computational model** of the international monetary system **with a larger number of agents and time periods**, complementing that of for instance Farhi and Maggiori (2017), and He et al. (2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "While our model confirms their \"*rationalization [of] the Triffin dilemma, [...] the common prediction regarding the natural and beneficial emergence of a multipolar world, the Nurkse warning that a multipolar world is more unstable than a Hegemon world, and the Keynesian argument that a scarcity of reserve assets under a gold standard or at the zero lower bound is recessionary*\", our framework further bridges these considerations to the secular trends followed by \"natural real rates\" and inflation for the past thirty years, **expliciting the causal links between forms of monetary anchoring and these secular trends.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model thus enables **calibration on real world data** that reproduces these trends over a long time period, **simulations on alternative future scenarii** on a detailed, country by country and quarter by quarter basis, and a **flexible and modular framework that can provide design possibilities for a strategy-proof monetary anchoring** which would counter the negative incentives, imbalances and trends that are arising from the current design (or lack of design) of the international monetary system.

    "### Part I : The link between monetary anchoring (safe asset shortage ?) and financial cycles (Borio's buildup hypothesis ?), inflation and globalization, monetary anchoring and long-term trends\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a model of monetary anchoring we aim to provide an unifying framework explaining how **it is in fact a safe asset shortage that *enabled* central banks such as the Fed (by providing them with less inflationary/deficit funding pressure) to \"keep output high today\", thus \"weakening the financial sector and narrowing policy choices tomorrow\" (Borio, 2019c)**. Hence the lower interest rate today - made possible in the US by the demand from the Rest of World for USD denominated safe assets - which raises the likelihood of a future burst, \"whose materialisation justifies even lower interest rates\" (which are themselves still made possible by the safe asset shortage). Hence lower and lower US rates, which spills over the rest of the world's monetary policies, thus creating a secular decline in natural real rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, **our model also highlights how globalization would have been the main driver of lower inflation worldwide** - an hypothesis first formulated by Rogoff (2003). Hence a potential explanation as to why the Fed and advanced economies' central banks, over-relying on inflation targeting rules and doubling down on efforts to reach the nominal target, initiated an excessively low rate cycle and thus effectively triggering the \"low rates beget lower rates\" financial buildup aforementioned. \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, our model of the existing monetary system provides an explanation of the \"secular long term rate trends\" as entirely a consequence of the current (lack of) monetary anchoring, fueled by misconceived models of the economy (Taylor rules, New Keynesian models...See Borio 2019c for a critic of these). \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, **in a world with a floating monetary anchor inflation can be seen as a corollary of the levels of stock view imbalances** (low inflation comes from excessive production, which is reflected within excessive debt, itself reflected in excessive financial risk, which builds up rampantly - because of traders reasoning along flow views of markets - before being only visible during bursts). **Price stability is hence dependant on the stability of the anchoring, which then has to be a sustainable, strategy-proof scheme**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "### Part II and III : Estimating counterfactuals ; privacy-preserving surveys to estimate fiscal latitude and yield curve control feasability ; optimal hybrid insurance/borrowing-lending contracts for a more sustainable anchoring\n",
    "\n",
    "**A simple calibration of our model coded in this notebook will show how the evolution of the inflation rate and reserve composition of the main economies, from 1945 to now, can be obtained from just a few initial and two discretionary inputs**. This computational and game-theoretic model can also provide guidelines for policies such as yield curve control, and conditionality on their feasibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, given privacy-preserving surveys such as those described in Abbe, Khandani, Lo, AER 2012, institutions such as the BIS could **use aggregated data to estimate how much governmental bonds can be issued by each country without a downgrading of its financing conditions and a potential raise in inflation, *all other parameters held equal*.** In the \"global game\" literature (à la Carlsson and van Damme 1993, Morris and Shin 1998, He et al 2020) this would equate the case in which some previously unobservable parameter (for instance the \"measure of relative strength between country 1 and country 2\" in He et al. AER 2020) will be made public, and in which the previously \"private signal each investor receives\" is identic, ie the noise vanished as in Morris and Shin 2003 (\"so fundamental uncertainty vanishes and only strategic uncertainty about each investors' relative rank remains\" - uncertainty which can also be partially solved by knowing through privacy-preserving surveys the *aggregated* ranks and willingness to fund from all investors, and this for each country).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **better financial safety nets and \"leaning against the wind\" policies can be implemented if such an aggregated funding information is coordinated by the BIS**, as the basis of tighter currency coordination for central banks to distribute at best shocks among them according to a negotiation and resolution mechanism similar to the hybrid insurance/borrowing and lending contract derived in Townsend, 1982. **We believe such a stabilization scheme to be Pareto improving, especially on what concerns negative incentives to *manipulate* one's exchange rate and \"game\" the international monetary system.** \n",

    "### Microfoundations, up to the central banks level\n",
    "\n",
    "For our model we will stay at a highly abstract, central bank level, game theoretic point of view. Indeed let's first note that **national debts and individual debts play along different rules**. Indeed, to adopt Graeber and Polanyi's language, insofar as individual debts are contracted along impersonal markets with \"foreign\" entities - people we don't know personally, with whom there is no preexisting history of trust nor incentive for future collaboration - so sets of rules and guarantees are needed to enforce the repayment by the borrower. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Countries among themselves are however known neighbors in the global village, condemned to interact with each other for eternity** (at least by the standards of our individual lives). Hence rules of debt closer to that of \"human economies\", in which neighbors are \"always slightly in debt to one another [...] - a delicate web made up of obligations to return three egggs or a bag of okra, ties renewed and recreated, as any one of them could be canceled out at any time\" (ibid, p.122), along with display of gifts, generosity and hierarchy following the much richer and more complex meanders of human psychology, which can not and could never be exactly quantified in monetary terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are however only at the beginning of a phase of truly \"globally\" connected planet, so that **the rules of individual and impersonal markets are still the ones been used between nations (through the monetary anchor, which exactly quantifies and enforces what countries owe each other)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***However what happens when a country defaults ?*** It can't be imprisoned, beaten to death to serve as example to others, etc. There is then **a friction there not existing in individual markets**, since countries have more \"relaxed\" rules of default, **that distort risk pricing and establish a \"hard\" separation between what are considered safe assets (they are then really safe), and not as safe assets (pretty much the vast majority of countries' debts)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we referred to as  \"top-down vs bottom-up modeling in international economics\": indeed, while Borio argues that \"in sharp contrast to the current standard New Keynesian frameworks, the friction underlying deviations of market from natural interest rates is a capital market failure rather than price (and possibly wage) stickiness\", we would like to add that **this \"capital market failure\" is in turn a result of bad incentives created by a even broader game, that of fiat monetary anchoring**.  Then village economy analogy we used in the previous part naturally calls for game theory models, such as those underpinning the borrowing and lending, and insurance literature as in Townend 1982, 1982a, 1989, and as in the \"global game\" literature."

    "### There are thus only countries in our model, let's say N countries, and each one with their national currencies (no goods for now!)\n",

    "We will start first with **a most basic multiagent asset allocation scheme**, that of Bogolmonaia and Moulin (2001)'s cake-eating game, which we will progressively complexify and merge with standard open macroeconomy models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed we believe that **this model provides a close analogy to real life operations** by central bank officers, and can complement existing models such as Mundell-Fleming **on how safety considerations are being carried out dynamically in time, along with risk vs returns logics**. Furthermore, this highly abstract model can merge well with existing macroeconomy models, **by enabling calibration of practical values in highly stylized model such as the Safe Asset Scarcity and Aggregate Demand version of IS/LM developed by Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas (AER, 2016)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, we believe that the superposition of games with incentives on top of existing models are **not competing but complementary views**, just as Roth's suspension bridge building analogy illustrates how in addition of \"simple, beautiful and indispensable physics\", \"bridge design also concerns metal fatigue, soil mechanics, and the sideways forces of waves and wind\". **International macroeconomics thus also unfolds within a game of economic competition and collaboration, whose rules - even if they \"might be impossible to be answered analytically\"** - must still be explored (and maybe computed), to allow \"bridges designed on the same basic model to be built longer and stronger over time, as the complexities and how to deal with them become better understood\" (Roth, 2002).\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "### Our model\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are in a fiat monetary anchoring, we postulate here that **each national currency's \"purchasing power is limited to the amount which trading partners accepts to receive\"** (here we can recall Schacht's analysis of \"the war of 1914, which provided telling proof of the fact that state-guaranteed paper money, unlike gold and silver coins, does not represent any substantial value [...]. The war of 1914 isolated Germany from the greater part of the world market.  The Mark had become unusable on enemy markets. It has lost its purchasing power\". (Schacht, *The Magic of Money*, p94).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence our model of the international monetary system, which consists in just countries. Each of these countries print fiat money, which has to be accepted by others in order for it to have any purchasing power. Hence **each country can be represented by a \"mice\"** (the country's aggregated investors - central bank managers and asset managers), **which absorbs the \"cakes\" (the fiat liabilities) generated by himself and by other countries**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The liability side can also more simply be viewed as bonds, link to the He et al. (2015) model of safe asset pricing. But multi round, multi players.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time is discreet, in rounds**, to represent the discretionary decision process of investors such as central banks and asset managers. To represent **private information and secrecy of the decision process**, all parameters involved in the decision process (each \"mice\"'s preference ordering of the \"cakes\", each \"mice\"'s absorption capacity at this round) are decided before the start of each round, and can't be modified once the round starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the round, **the allocation algorithm follows that of Bogolmonaia and Moulin (2001)**. \"Mices\" simultaneously absorb each others' cakes (the trade process, à la Wicksell triangle) at different absorption speed (if one views a round as a new Treasury bills emission auction, some reserve managers have bigger budget and bidding capacities, here reflected by the different absorption speed), and each one following its own preference ranking. **When a cake by one country is finished the countries that were eating it move to the item below in their rankings** (end of the Bogolmonia and Moulin 2001 algorithm. We chose it because of its versatility, its natural illustration of the safe asset shortage - see just below as to ***what happens if specific cakes are left unfinished at the end of a round*** - and to prepare for the axiomatic analysis we will conduct in Part II to make the anchoring game sustainable and strategy-proof). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each country's aggregated investors (central bank reserve managers and asset managers) stores what they absorbed in the country's aggregated reserves (central bank reserves and asset managers funds). **The state of the world at round T can thus be represented by one NxN endowment matrix**, which records how much cakes in total each country has generated up to round T, and which countries are holding which proportion of these cakes. For convention we can fix column j of this matrix as all the cakes issued by country j, and line i of this matrix the cakes absorbed by country i. Cell (i,j) hence denotes the size of the cake issued by country j that country i absorbed into its own reserve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that what the \"mice\" has absorbed can be seen as the \"asset\" side of a country, whereas all the pieces of \"cakes\" that it generated can be seen as the \"liability\" side of that country (to relate to the view of the US as \"the world's banker\", cf Despres, Kindleberger and Salant 1966).\n",
    "\n",
    "**At the end of each round (each round has a pre-fixed duration) a country's cake that hasn't been totally absorbed will face a devaluation** (since the rest of the world is denying it its current purchasing power), which is reflected in the endowment matrix as a decrease in value of the parts of all reserves that contained pieces of cakes (from all previous rounds, not just this round) from that country (so the endowment matrix is normalized to an unique unit of account !). This can be seen as decreasing the values of an entire column j in the endowment matrix, if country j's cake hasn't been totally absorbed by himself or others at the end of the round.\n",

But when excess demand its price increase, so decreased rate (?). \n",

    "\n",
    "Countries' preferences ordering can be for instance a function of their trading preferences, their trading partners' cakes' \"safety\", interest rate, sizes, strategic alliances.... See in more details in code cells below how rankings and cakes are generated by each country at each round, and on how endowments change according to countries' behaviours. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For now let's assume that each ranking is done according to true preferences, and that there is no attempt 'to manipulate' the game**. Indeed here we first want to see **what long-term 'natural' tendencies come out of this game** (and we postulate that in real life most private investors like asset managers don't think about the 'global game' consequences à la He et al., AER 2020, except in an Instability zone à la Farhi, Maggiori, QJE 2018. Hence preference ranking that are parametrized computationally by weights on safety, interest rates and inflation, and considerations around the sizes of each economies, etc listed in the code lines at the end of this paragraph). \n",
    "*Part II and strategic proofness will examine this postulate more in details, and define more precisely **how gaming the system actually happens (manipulating the exchange rates instead of manipulating the safety of other countries' bonds)** and how to prevent this*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Countries can adjust the interest rates they pay on their \"cakes\" to make it more attractive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inflation in our model can first be seen as just the corollary of devaluations (a country that devalues see the prices of goods imported increase - hence inflation). For now because we don't take goods into account **we can just assume that all goods are imported, from a fictional third party supplier of goods not playing the game** - which is made possible by the normalization of our game to an unique unit of account). A more sophisticated view of inflation in our model would be related to purchasing power ; indeed, **if other countries *accept* an expanded purchasing power by a country by including more of its issued pieces of cake in their reserve, than the inflationary pressure for this country would be lesser** (and the lesser the inflationary pressure the less effective lowering interest rates will be at pushing inflation up). \n",

    "### Introducing our model of monetary anchoring, secular trends, and the incentives to \"cheat\" such an anchoring game creates\n",
    "\n",
    "Mundell’s redundancy (or \"n-1\") problem illustrates how international finance can be interpreted by some as a zero-sum game, with many prisoners dilemma problems. Such a view logically leads some countries to **try to \"game\" the international monetary system**, first and foremost through their managed floating currencies (hence the vocabulary around \"manipulation\" on what concerns exchange rate levels).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, since the dollar unpegged from gold and some currencies started to float, exchange rate manipulation has been tolerated up to some point - principally because of the increased difficulty in pinpointing exactly what the \"fair\" parity between the two legs of a currency pair would be, which itself would influence in return all other currency pairs these two legs are involved in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"fair exchange rate levels\" itself changed meaning, between a Gold Standard world in which the anchor aimed at adjusting (im-)balances of payments, and a free floating world \"in a global liquidity trap, in which the exchange rate affects the *distribution* of recessions across countries\" (Caballero, Farhi, Gourinchas, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we provide a model and simulations in an interactive Notebook format to load and play directly with the Matlab code **to examine how international monetary systems relying on specified nominal anchors (silver and gold, sterling then USD, bancor sometimes maybe)** - though the most \"natural\" form of anchoring, as it provides a solution to commitment and reneging issues - **create incentives that might be correlated with hegemonic wars** *(political scientists - Wallerstein, Modelski, Organski or more recently Goldstein - have long explored these cycles, but economists also advanced some causal hypothesis. Vilfredo Pareto in his \"Forme di fenomeni economici e previsioni\" for instance postulated that ascending and descending phases in international trade are linked to more or less available saving levels, and that period of social unrest and cross-country wars occur in such descending phases)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, our model's extension with goods, in a separate paper, will lead to a reinterpretation of Ibn Khaldun's imperial cycles (the intuition being that of Paul Kennedy's emphasis on productive capacities in determining winners of wars, as laid out in *Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000 (1987)*, which determines the cycle of dominant elites - the ones most able to channel and retain - capture! - the productive resources and capacities produced by the Rest of World. For instance the Victorian age UK, the gilded age US, and now the post-economic opening China. And, within a cycle, the eroding of the elite's \"productivity capture\" due to rising inequaity, rising intra-elite competition, etc has put down in complex dynamic systems format by Peter Turchin. We will aim to bridge these three frameworks.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, let's just **recognize (through our Part I) that the current international monetary systems provides incentives / insidious pressure** (through inflationary pressure) to **hijack countries' *sustainable level of consumption* to an overvalued purchasing power that satisfies the safe asset shortage** (but which also leads to a decline in long-term interest rates, lowering the potency of monetary tools, while building up financial risk, as a side effect). \n",
    "\n",
    "So **an optimal scheme need to both *counter* (for safer countries) this incentive to over-issue debt, while *prevent* (for not as safe countries) the possibility of manipulating its currency for faster growth and development** (which come at the cost of increasing the safe asset shortage, hence adding pressure for safer countries to over-issue).\n",

    "### A role for mechanism design \n",
    "\n",
    "Central banks' reserve management operations and the decision process revolving around them naturally call for game theory models, such as those underpinning the contract theory, borrowing and lending and to some extent medieval village economy literature. \n",

    "But exchange rate determination in practice is through multinational bank (cf Gabaix, Maggiori)\n",

    "So one needs an unifying framework around exchange rate levels, exchange rate volatility, financial safety net, policy debate on dilemma vs trilemma, leaning...(cf Domestic financial cycle, vs global financial cycle)\n",

    "### Mechanism design concerns :\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first observe that the original Bogolmonaia and Moulin's good assignment game mainly concerns itself mainly with **what axiomatic properties such a game has**. Notably that it is **ordinally efficient, fair** (i.e. if everyone prefers his or her assignment to the assignment of anyone else with respect to the reported preferences) ***equal treatment of equals*, but not strategy proof** (i.e. agents might try to manipulate the game - for instance if too many people like the second choice of an agent as their first choice, then this agent may be better off if he starts eating from his second choice instead of his first choice). Furthermore, they proved that **there is no mechanism that satisfies ordinal efficiency, strategy-proofness and equal treatment of equals**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What do these imply for our adaptation in monetary anchoring ?** Let's first note how the entire language around ***\"manipulating one's exchange rate\"*** hints at such market design considerations. Indeed, if one combines a non strategy proof mechanism with the long-term incentives of a repeated game based on this mechanism leading to a \"winner takes all\" reserve currency (and economy), then any agent will have incentives to try to manipulate the game to try to be better off in the resulting distribution (and become closer for instance to being a \"world's banker\", cf Despres, Kindleberger and Salant 1966).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, NB : Bogolmonaia and Moulin's scheme's ordinal efficiency is not that important in our case, since there are secondary markets on which countries' debts can be acquired at any points in time - even though potentially at a higher price. What Bogolmonaia and Moulin's model was used to highlight was indeed rather to decide which countries' debts will NOT be fully endorsed by the end of a round. And since this is the only case incurring a \"penalty\" to countries in our model, let's examine what factor can play there (hence which levers of \"manipulation\" countries have).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "### Collectively preparing a new Bretton Woods :\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also note here that it is the approach we are following so far that is of interest - the specific model and incentives analysis indeed might change in the future, but hopefully many bright minds from market design and contract theory will contribute in examining the monetary anchoring supergame, so that the world comes ready when a new Bretton Woods will be called, and that the contingencies at that time do not dictate its outcomes. After all, “there is, in particular, all the difference between deliberately creating a system within which competition will work as beneficially as possible and passively accepting institutions as they are” (Hayek, The Road to Serfdom)\n",
    "So where are the \"tension points\" in our game ? Let's first note where a country can intervene (the size of the cake it issues at the beginning of each round, its interest rates, its eating speed during each round, and its preference ranking), and where it can not (the same parameters for every other countries, plus inflation rates for all countries). Then where privacy intervenes - the cake sizes and eating speeds are known by all at the start of a round, but each country's ranking lists remains in practice private (so in our game the sizes of the cakes issued at the beginning of each round do not factor in the potential rankings). Let's recall there the application of the literature on optimal borrowing lending - and how privacy-preserving technologies can now allow implementations of some schemes designed in the 80s (Townsend 1982, and how technology lowered the cost so became interesting enough to use these more complicated form of contracts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then how do countries potentially improve their lot through interactions with other countries (one could call that manipulating the game - though what I mean here is more on how to interact with other countries so that in the same rules of the same game your outcome improves) ? It has to deal with the private information part of the game, since if known then a country could just adapt its own parameters accordingly (for instance if known all what other countries will eat, with what speed and in what time, one could know until what cake size he'll be able to issue successfully this round). \n",
    "\n",
    "Also looking in more details in how these eating order ranking done by each country is made - we can note that trade partnerships at least intervenes in most of the different modeling of how the ranking is done (one could also imagine military alliances, size of countries' economies...). And what is the best way to gain more trading partners ? By producing more goods, of better quality, or cheaper. So we can relate here this fact from the \"exchange rate manipulation\" language noted earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, a better monetary anchoring game for us will consist in both giving better information to each country about the aggregate other countries' private rankings, so that it can better decide on the size of the cake/debt it issues at a given round/quarter, all the while ensuring that competitive devaluations are avoided. So any optimal monetary anchoring scheme has then to be both an exchange rate stabilization scheme (that still allows to allow for exchange rates to help mitigate unforecasted shocks, and to account for cultural differences among countries - as some exporting countries might agree to finance more importing countries) and a privacy-preserving demand aggregation scheme. And this on a multilateral scheme rather than on networks of bilateral trading partners - as for us only a truly flexible reserve composition and global governance and negotiation platform can lead countries to compete fully on economic terms with less incentive to wage war."

Different values of the nominal exchange rate correspond to different values of the real exchange rate, and therefore to different levels of output and the current account across countries. This mechanism means that, via expenditure switching effects, the exchange rate affects the distribution of recessions across countries in a global liquidity trap. This creates fertile grounds for zerosum beggar-thy-neighbor devaluations achieved by direct interventions in exchange rate markets, stimulating output and improving the current account in one country at the expense of the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to stabilise the exchange rates, in our game theoretic cake-eating model, at the core of our proposal resides the *multi-currency* nature of the market making activity of international banks, which we aim at replicating at a central bank level. A first underlying reason would be that of *collection of risk* - in the line of bigger risks for higher returns. Additionally (and that is a second reason for emphasizing the multi-currency aspect) in our case the additional risk is that of adding on more exotic currencies such as the South East Asian ones in a reserve basket previously not containing them - that could thus act as an additional cushion to mitigate external shock on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is then possible to see that for such a **multi-currency reserve balance sheet** the profit objective of traditional private market maker is here also aligned with the volatility stabilization objective of the central banks involved, and that the mechanisms underlying these forms of interventions would be conceptually the same as the ones through which financiers' alterations to their balance sheets affect both the level and volatility of exchange rates.\n",

    "The design question then, critical to the feasibility of such a multi-currencies account for instance, is on **how to create and foster this form of collaboration among different central banks**.\n",

    "### Computing these multilateral balance sheets, through privacy-preserving methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy-preserving methods like multiparty computation *(referring to the financial adaptation of Abbe, Khandani, Lo, 2012, which build on Yao 1982; Goldreich, Micali, and Wigderson 1987; Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and Wigderson 1988; Chaum, Crépeau, and Damgard 1988; Beaver, Micali, and Rogaway\n",
    "1990; Cramer et al. 1999)* provide a clear and useful framework on which to **reach agreement on the different exchange and interest rate objectives pursued by respective central banks**. This is why this section will build on the language and framework of these privacy-preserving methods - which again don't have to be *actually* implemented for the interventions to be conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Thus central banks would first each allocate some funds denominated in their national currencies, plus portions of their reserves in each of the currencies they would like to stabilize their exchange rates with. \n",
    "2. They would then set-up the daily volatility bands they want their national currencies to stay in, which proportion of reserves they are ready to commit to the operation, and what amount of risk or leverage they are ready to bear on any derivative instrument used in the process (for convenience let's imagine the updates are only feasible at a regular interval - for instance once a day or once a week. We are then in a discreet time setting). These three points are where privacy-preserving methods might be applied, since participant central banks wouldn't want for instance *the entirety* of the reserves they engaged in that fund to be potentially used to defend the currency of another participating country)\n",
    "3. Thus a daily total amount of reserves committed to each currency could be computed using the aforementioned methods, without individual inputs from each central bank being revealed). Note that the viewing of the results of these computations can also be restrained so that each central bank only sees the pooling of reserves allocated to him - and not that allocated to others. In this fashion, both inputs and outputs of these forms of computations have modular privacy settings, that can be deployed according to participants preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous paragraph described mostly a pooling of reserves, quite similar to what already exists in the Chiang Mai Initiative, but **applied on a continuous and systematic basis rather than just during times of extreme stress** (in fact one of the goals of this automatic and systematic market smoothing is to potentially provide in-commensurable psychological relief and precious time for governments to *avoid* times of extreme stress). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also **other benefits to having a common multicurrency account: first, the mechanisms derived to stabilize a currency vs the international currencies part of the reserves portfolio can now also be used to also stabilize more exotic currency pairs** (but among natural trading partners) such as the MYR/IDR. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, **our scheme would constitute an implementation of the \"optimal capital controls**, that should lean against the wind by requiring a temporary tax on inflows and a subsidy on outflows (if dealing with sudden inflows, the opposite if dealing with a sudden stop)\" from Farhi and Werning (2013).\n",

That lead us to provide several scenarii in how the models' parameters will change following Covid-19's increase in debts *(these parameters from the model being for instance the change in debt levels, while debt absorption speed are maintained roughly constant. Different degrees in shifts in trade and supply chain preferences are also considered)*.

However in these small probability event the US go through an initial bubble fueled by the decrease of China, that then collapses back to the initial level (and note that after this collapse China's share is also back to the initial level - but with the cost of a global contraction, especially for all EM markets). **And with the caveat provided just above that this debt model doesn't take into account other incentives and consequences created by such dynamics - small probabilities in economic contraction in one country might leading to escalating tensions on other dimensions as well*\n",

    "**In fact, the global loosening of the monetary anchoring** (no rules determines how much USD can or should be printed to optimize the global economy) **might even be a driver of the secular decline in global real interest rates over much of the past 30 years**. However, while there are now several competing theories aiming at explaining this \"secular stagnation\", none of them explicitly examines how the anchoring of the international monetary system might (or might not) have played a role in causing this trend. \n",
    "\n",
    "**That is why we will try to provide here a framework based on modelling the anchoring as a mechanism design problem**, to explicit parameters that changed between now and the Gold Standard, before/after 1971, and which might provide a framework linking the safe asset shortage view of today's monetary anchoring, to Borio's financial cycle buildup warning (a possible consequence of the more flexible anchoring). **Such a framework would also allow to explore the different conditions under which yield curve control by the Fed would work without raising inflation, conditions which would lead to parallel financial systems to emerge, and conditions which might lead to Triffin events (and how they would unfold).**\n",

    "From the parameters of the cake eating model below, and they interact with each other, we can attempt to draw a few parallels with the competing hypothesis of Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas, and of Borio. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, let's first note how the cake-eating model itself **is based** off scarcity - indeed if central banks *could* absorb all imbalances and debt at each round then in our model there would no default, no devaluation, and all assets would be considered safe. However given the limited *duration* parameter *(see the parameter duration_T_updated_history introduced below, noting the records of how long was the timer for each round. A round ends when this timer ends, or when countries ate all the cakes if faster than the timer, with the timer changing at each round depending on the total cake sizes and total eating speed ratio, so that it increases rather steadily)*, only the countries that first manages to \"offload\" their debts avoid devaluation and maintain a \"safe\" reputation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, let's note how the two parameters of how much cakes (ie debts) each country is generating, and how much cakes each country can absorb, at each round, are proxies of how developed/stretched a country's financial system is. One can note how past history of safety in a country can lead to an expanding emission/absorption cycle, which might eventually burst à la Minsky, related to Borio's hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence two scenarii : one in which a few safe countries' debts are pursued in higher demand than what they emit (safe asset shortage), which lowers the interest rate. But this scarcity only incentivizes them to stretch more their financial systems so that they both emit and absorb more pieces of cake. Up until a situation in which they emitted too much pieces of cake compared to the demand, in which case they suffer a devaluation requiring them to either emit less pieces of cake, absborb more of their own (through decreased interest rate as described by Borio), or convince more countries to absorb theirs first. \n",
