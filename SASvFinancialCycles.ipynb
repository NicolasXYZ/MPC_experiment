    "### Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "Mundell’s redundancy (or \"n-1\") problem illustrates how international finance can be interpreted by some as a zero-sum game, with many prisoners dilemma problems. Such a view logically leads some countries to try to \"game\" the international monetary system, first and foremost through their managed floating currencies (hence the vocabulary around \"manipulation\" on what concerns exchange rate levels).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we provide a model and simulations in an interactive Notebook format to load and play directly with the Matlab code **to examine how international monetary systems relying on specified nominal anchors (silver and gold, sterling then USD, bancor sometimes maybe)** - though the most \"natural\" form of anchoring, as it provides a solution to commitment and reneging issues - **create incentives that might be correlated with hegemonic wars** *(political scientists - Wallerstein, Modelski, Organski or more recently Goldstein - have long explored these cycles, but economists also advanced some causal hypothesis. Vilfredo Pareto in his \"Forme di fenomeni economici e previsioni\" for instance postulated that ascending and descending phases in international trade are linked to more or less available saving levels, and that period of social unrest and cross-country wars occur in such descending phases)*."

    "### Safe asset shortage or financial cycle buildup - the two sides of the same (anchor-) coin ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dollar unpegged from gold and some currencies started to float, exchange rate manipulation has been tolerated up to some point - principally because of the increased difficulty in pinpointing exactly what the \"fair\" parity between the two legs of a currency pair would be, which itself would influence in return all other currency pairs these two legs are involved in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"fair exchange rate levels\" itself changed meaning, between a Gold Standard world in which the anchor aimed at adjusting (im-)balances of payments, and a free floating world \"in a global liquidity trap, in which the exchange rate affects the *distribution* of recessions across countries\" (Caballero, Farhi, Gourinchas, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In fact, the global loosening of the monetary anchoring** (no rules determines how much USD can or should be printed to optimize the global economy) **might even be a driver of the secular decline in global real interest rates over much of the past 30 years**. However, while there are now several competing theories aiming at explaining this \"secular stagnation\", none of them explicitly examines how the anchoring of the international monetary system might (or might not) have played a role in causing this trend. \n",
    "\n",
    "**That is why we will try to provide here a framework based on modelling the anchoring as a mechanism design problem**, to explicit parameters that changed between now and the Gold Standard, before/after 1971, and which might provide a framework linking the safe asset shortage view of today's monetary anchoring, to Borio's financial cycle buildup warning (a possible consequence of the more flexible anchoring). **Such a framework would also allow to explore the different conditions under which yield curve control by the Fed would work without raising inflation, conditions which would lead to parallel financial systems to emerge, and conditions which might lead to Triffin events (and how they would unfold).**"

    "Central banks' reserve management operations and the decision process revolving around them naturally call for game theory models, such as those underpinning the contract theory, borrowing and lending and to some extent medieval village economy literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start first with a most basic multiagent asset allocation scheme, that of Bogolmonaia and Moulin (2001)'s cake-eating game, which we will progressively complexify and merge with standard open macroeconomy models. Indeed we believe that this model provides a close analogy to real life operations by central bank officers, and can complement existing models such as Mundell-Fleming how safety considerations are being carried out dynamically in time, along with risk vs returns logics. Furthermore, this highly abstract model can merge well with existing macroeconomy models, **by enabling calibration of values in stylized model such as the Safe Asset Scarcity and Aggregate Demand version of IS/LM developed by Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas (AER, 2016)**. Indeed, we believe that the superposition of games with incentives on top of existing models are not competing but complementary views, just as Roth's suspension bridge building analogy illustrates how in addition of \"simple, beautiful and indispensable physics\", *\"bridge design also concerns metal fatigue, soil mechanics, and the sideways forces of waves and wind\"*. **International macroeconomics also unfolds within a game of economic competition and collaboration, whose rules - even if they \"might be impossible to be answered analytically\"** - must still be explored (and maybe computed), to allow \"bridges designed on the same basic model to be built longer and stronger over time, as the complexities and how to deal with them become better understood\" (Roth, 2002)."

    "- If at the end of a round a country's cake has not been completed absorbed (by itself and/or by other countries) it suffers a devaluation - i.e. every the value of pieces of cake from this country store in others' endowments is decreased, and its interest rate rises.\n",
    "- Countries' ranking preferences are function of their trading preferences, their trading partners' debts' \"safety\", interest rate, size, and some randomness. **See in more details below how rankings and cakes are generated by each country at each round, and on how endowments change according to countries' behaviours.**\n",

    "### The link with the Safe Asset Shortage hypothesis, and Borio's financial cycle build up hypothesis \n",

    "From the parameters of the cake eating model below, and they interact with each other, we can attempt to draw a few parallels with the competing hypothesis of Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas, and of Borio. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, let's first note how the cake-eating model itself **is based** off scarcity - indeed if central banks *could* absorb all imbalances and debt at each round then in our model there would no default, no devaluation, and all assets would be considered safe. However given the limited *duration* parameter *(see the parameter duration_T_updated_history introduced below, noting the records of how long was the timer for each round. A round ends when this timer ends, or when countries ate all the cakes if faster than the timer, with the timer changing at each round depending on the total cake sizes and total eating speed ratio, so that it increases rather steadily)*, only the countries that first manages to \"offload\" their debts avoid devaluation and maintain a \"safe\" reputation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, let's note how the two parameters of how much cakes (ie debts) each country is generating, and how much cakes each country can absorb, at each round, are proxies of how developed/stretched a country's financial system is. One can note how past history of safety in a country can lead to an expanding emission/absorption cycle, which might eventually burst à la Minsky, related to Borio's hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence two scenarii : one in which a few safe countries' debts are pursued in higher demand than what they emit (safe asset shortage), which lowers the interest rate. But this scarcity only incentivizes them to stretch more their financial systems so that they both emit and absorb more pieces of cake. Up until a situation in which they emitted too much pieces of cake compared to the demand, in which case they suffer a devaluation requiring them to either emit less pieces of cake, absborb more of their own (through decreased interest rate as described by Borio), or convince more countries to absorb theirs first. \n",

    "\n",
    "We present here the detailed code used for the simulations. For that we first calibrate the model to match the main trends and events observed from 1945 to now (2020). Being able to capture these features of past history will provide confidence and intuition in the model's inner workings. That lead us to provide several scenarii in how the models' parameters will change following Covid-19's increase in debts *(these parameters from the model being for instance the change in debt levels, while debt absorption speed are maintained roughly constant. Different degrees in shifts in trade and supply chain preferences are also considered)*. We thus generate 50 more rounds after a common departing point, and report here the different outcomes, and the different probabilities of each outcome (since they are intervention of random perturbations in the model the probabilities of each outcome is calculated based on how many of different random sequence generate this specific outcome).\n",

    "- **similar results in the case of everything constant, with just additional reliance on trade with China** (for instance for masks, medical supplies etc). The economic contraction is smaller, and the global reserve contraction as well. This could be interpreted by the fact that the additional trade with China is flushed in its reserve (the increase can be seen in the graph below), used to acquire other countries' debt (inferred from the lowering of global interest rates) and thus sustaining economic activity \n",

    "- **in the case of everything constant among all countries except China and US, who in that scenario stop trading with each other**, they are small probabilities of a global contraction (less reserves, less debts, less GDP growth) that preserves the overall shares of each country in the global economy - except for China in the global economy which suffers more. However in these small probability event the US go through an initial bubble fueled by the decrease of China, that then collapses back to the initial level (and note that after this collapse China's share is also back to the initial level - but with the cost of a global contraction, especially for all EM markets). **And with the caveat provided just above that this debt model doesn't take into account other incentives and consequences created by such dynamics - small probabilities in economic contraction in one country might leading to escalating tensions on other dimensions as well*\n",

    "- **finally, in the case of our proposed stabilization scheme** *(details in the paper - in the model it is just reflected as more willingness from participating countries to accept others' devaluation - see the commented code in the last cells of this notebook. Un-implemented here is also the extra information each country will have on how much latitude they will have at each round on their debt, which should also help in addition of the effects produced here to stabilize debts, interest rates and balance global reserve currencies)* the effects of all above scenarii are smoothen, with much more balanced reserve currencies (at least 3 currencies accounting each more than 20% of the global share of reserves, with the exact currencies - most often Germany ie the Euro, or the JPY - switching depending on the random shocks, but without adverse effects on all countries - including on the US even though the dollar loses its monopoly as reserve currency)\n",

    "### A quick review of our strategy proof scheme :\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of our proposal resides the *multi-currency* nature of the market making activity of international banks, which we aim at replicating at a central bank level. A first underlying reason would be that of *collection of risk* - in the line of bigger risks for higher returns. Additionally (and that is a second reason for emphasizing the multi-currency aspect) in our case the additional risk is that of adding on more exotic currencies such as the South East Asian ones in a reserve basket previously not containing them - that could thus act as an additional cushion to mitigate external shock on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is then possible to see that for such a **multi-currency reserve balance sheet** the profit objective of traditional private market maker is here also aligned with the volatility stabilization objective of the central banks involved, and that the mechanisms underlying these forms of interventions would be conceptually the same as the ones through which financiers' alterations to their balance sheets affect both the level and volatility of exchange rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design question then, critical to the feasibility of such a multi-currencies account for instance, is on **how to create and foster this form of collaboration among different central banks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing these multilateral balance sheets, through privacy-preserving methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy-preserving methods like multiparty computation *(referring to the financial adaptation of Abbe, Khandani, Lo, 2012, which build on Yao 1982; Goldreich, Micali, and Wigderson 1987; Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and Wigderson 1988; Chaum, Crépeau, and Damgard 1988; Beaver, Micali, and Rogaway\n",
    "1990; Cramer et al. 1999)* provide a clear and useful framework on which to **reach agreement on the different exchange and interest rate objectives pursued by respective central banks**. This is why this section will build on the language and framework of these privacy-preserving methods - which again don't have to be *actually* implemented for the interventions to be conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Thus central banks would first each allocate some funds denominated in their national currencies, plus portions of their reserves in each of the currencies they would like to stabilize their exchange rates with. \n",
    "2. They would then set-up the daily volatility bands they want their national currencies to stay in, which proportion of reserves they are ready to commit to the operation, and what amount of risk or leverage they are ready to bear on any derivative instrument used in the process (for convenience let's imagine the updates are only feasible at a regular interval - for instance once a day or once a week. We are then in a discreet time setting). These three points are where privacy-preserving methods might be applied, since participant central banks wouldn't want for instance *the entirety* of the reserves they engaged in that fund to be potentially used to defend the currency of another participating country)\n",
    "3. Thus a daily total amount of reserves committed to each currency could be computed using the aforementioned methods, without individual inputs from each central bank being revealed). Note that the viewing of the results of these computations can also be restrained so that each central bank only sees the pooling of reserves allocated to him - and not that allocated to others. In this fashion, both inputs and outputs of these forms of computations have modular privacy settings, that can be deployed according to participants preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous paragraph described mostly a pooling of reserves, quite similar to what already exists in the Chiang Mai Initiative, but **applied on a continuous and systematic basis rather than just during times of extreme stress** (in fact one of the goals of this automatic and systematic market smoothing is to potentially provide in-commensurable psychological relief and precious time for governments to *avoid* times of extreme stress). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also **other benefits to having a common multicurrency account: first, the mechanisms derived to stabilize a currency vs the international currencies part of the reserves portfolio can now also be used to also stabilize more exotic currency pairs** (but among natural trading partners) such as the MYR/IDR. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, **our scheme would constitute an implementation of the \"optimal capital controls**, that should lean against the wind by requiring a temporary tax on inflows and a subsidy on outflows (if dealing with sudden inflows, the opposite if dealing with a sudden stop)\" from Farhi and Werning (2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it would **help by design including more currencies in the global reserve distribution and alleviating the \"safe asset shortage\"** (Caballero, Farhi, Gourinchas, 2017)."
