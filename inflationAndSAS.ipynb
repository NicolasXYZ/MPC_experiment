    "Our model harks back to Keynes’ rejection of the \"natural\" rate of interest in his General Theory. Building on the argument that there is no single natural rate of interest that balances the economy at full employment, and the possibility that various paths depending on the sequence of monetary policy actions raise or lower the prospect of the economy evolving along unsustainable paths - including on what concerns inflation, we define a game-theoretic model between central banks to illustrate how globalization and the new entrants in world markets it brought along could have driven down long-term rates and inflation (a hypothesis first formulated by Rogoff, 2003).\n",
    "\n",
    "Following that view, there would be an international component of inflation, the same across all countries, in addition to each country's domestic term. And, in globalized markets, country's domestic inflation terms might react to central banks' policies to a lesser extent than what would be necessary to achieve central bankers' nominal targets. Attempts to forcefully do so might even lead, as described by Borio, 2019c, in making them act \"like a forcing variable that sustains the system at some arbitrary level for an extended duration\". Then, given path dependence, actions today condition outcomes tomorrow that, in turn, constrain choices taken at that point. And they can do so in ways that increasingly narrow the room for manoeuvre and worsen economic outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "And what might be true of interest rates should be true for inflation as well, according to our unifying framework. Supply of money and supply of goods are, after all, the two faces of the same coin. Thus, secular decline in world interest rates should be matched by a secular decline in the international component of inflation. Hence, by targeting the wrong values and by following wrong analysis for inflation's various components we might be building up risks, whether through monetary or fiscal stimulii.  Economic policies consists, after all, for a good part in fixing the flaws of previously applied models - for no model is perfect in itself, with any one model used long enough building up its set of imbalances over time. \n",

    "#### The link between monetary anchoring (*is there a safe asset shortage ?*) and financial cycles (*is Borio's financial buildup hypothesis correct ?*), inflation and globalization, monetary anchoring and long-term trends\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "Through a model of monetary anchoring we aim to provide an unifying framework explaining how it is in fact a safe asset shortage that enabled central banks such as the Fed (by creating an environment with less inflationary/deficit funding pressure) to \"keep output high today\", thus \"weakening the financial sector and narrowing policy choices tomorrow\" (Borio, 2019c). Hence lower interest rate today, first made possible in the US by the demand from the Rest of World for USD denominated safe assets, but which then raised the likelihood of a future burst, \"whose materialisation justifies even lower interest rates\" (still made possible by the still ongoing safe asset shortage). Hence lower and lower US rates, which spilled over the rest of the world's monetary policies, thus creating a secular decline in natural real rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, **our model also highlights how globalization would have been the main driver of lower inflation worldwide** - an hypothesis first formulated by Rogoff (2003). Indeed, if one views globalization as the connection of advanced countries' consumer markets to developing countries' industrializing labor forces, while the supply of USD (the global trading and reserve currency) is roughly stable (at least compared to the scale and the magnitude of the new production forces introduced to global markets), then following John Stuart Mill's demand and supply factors determining the value of money (ie what money can acquire ; \"the supply of money being, in a nutshell, the totality of money is circulation at the present moment [...]. The demand of currency is composed, on the other hand, of all merchandises put to sale\". John Stuart Mill, *Principles of Political Economy*, book III, chapter VIII, paragraph 2, Paris, 1861) global disinflation occurs naturally as a consequence of globalization. Even more, inflation in every country is then *at least partly* defined by a component resulting **only** from international trade and finance parameters beyond domestic parameters (let's call this global component common to all countries the \"neutral\" inflation rate). Interesting questions follow, that we'll try to answer here : \"*how much does this \"neutral\" inflation rate account for in domestic inflation rates ?*\" and \"*how much influence do monetary policies have on inflation rates then* ?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, let's imagine for a minute that monetary policies only have a limited action on this \"neutral\" inflation rate, such that **no matter how much monetary easings are allowed the inflation rate will never reach the target**.\n",
    "An important consequence that then follows, if we write inflation $\\pi_t$ as a combination of this \"neutral\" inflation rate $\\widetilde{\\pi_t}$ mainly determined by international trade and finance and only *partially* responsive to Taylor rules, and of a financial asset price index $a_t$ such as $\\pi_t = \\widetilde{\\pi_t}+ a_t$ , then changing interest rates $i_t$ to change $\\pi_t$ will affect domestic financial asset prices $a_t$ to **all the extent** in which the \"neutral\" inflation $\\widetilde{\\pi_t}$ does not react to the interest rate change. It can thus be worth studying what factors affect this \"neutral\" inflation rate and how much power each country has over it (to explain inflation rates that can still differ from one country to another). These are the objects of the study of our Part I.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our model and hypothesis are confirmed, then the Fed and advanced economies' central banks' over-reliance on inflation targeting rules will lead them to double down on efforts to make this \"neutral\" inflation rate reach their domestic target, in the process compounding the \"low rates beget lower rates\" financial buildup aforementioned with *active* inflation of financial assets and bubbles, hence riskier and riskier, and more and more ample financial cycles (as in Borio 2019c). \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, our Part I's model of the existing monetary system provides an explanation of the \"secular long term rate trends\" as entirely a consequence of the current (lack of) monetary anchoring, compounded by misconceived models of inflation and of monetary policies (Taylor rules as above, DGSE and New Keynesian models as criticized in Borio 2019c). \n",

    "### II - Microfoundations, up to the central banks level\n",
    "\n",
    "For our model we will stay at a highly abstract, central bank level, game theoretic point of view. Indeed let's first note that **national debts and individual debts play along different rules**. Indeed, to adopt Graeber and Polanyi's language, insofar as individual debts are contracted along impersonal markets with \"foreign\" entities - people we don't know personally, with whom there is no preexisting history of trust nor incentive for future collaboration - so sets of rules and guarantees are needed to enforce the repayment by the borrower. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Countries among themselves are however known neighbors in the global village, condemned to interact with each other for eternity** (at least by the standards of our individual lives). Hence rules of debt closer to that of \"human economies\", in which neighbors are \"always slightly in debt to one another [...] - a delicate web made up of obligations to return three egggs or a bag of okra, ties renewed and recreated, as any one of them could be canceled out at any time\" (ibid, p.122), along with display of gifts, generosity and hierarchy following the much richer and more complex meanders of human psychology, which can not and could never be exactly quantified in monetary terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are however only at the beginning of a phase of truly \"globally\" connected planet, so that **the rules of individual and impersonal markets are still the ones been used between nations (through the monetary anchor, which exactly quantifies and enforces what countries owe each other)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***However what happens when a country defaults ?*** It can't be imprisoned, beaten to death to serve as example to others, etc. There is then **a friction there not existing in individual markets**, since countries have more \"relaxed\" rules of default, **that distort risk pricing and establish a \"hard\" separation between what are considered safe assets (they are then really safe), and not as safe assets (pretty much the vast majority of countries' debts)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we referred to as  \"top-down vs bottom-up modeling in international economics\": indeed, while Borio argues that \"in sharp contrast to the current standard New Keynesian frameworks, the friction underlying deviations of market from natural interest rates is a capital market failure rather than price (and possibly wage) stickiness\", we would like to add that **this \"capital market failure\" is in turn a result of bad incentives created by a even broader game, that of fiat monetary anchoring**.  Especially, different countries and cultures might provide different preferences and behaviours both at the micro level, which have to be accounted for in any macro framework derived from these foundations (or, as in our case, be left as exogeneous parameters that can be adjusted on a country by country basis). Certain of these behaviours are productive for the global economy, while others are toxic, and have to be limited by the system of anchoring. Then the village economy analogy we used in the previous part naturally calls for game theory models, such as those underpinning the borrowing and lending and insurance literature as in Townend JPE 1982, 1982a, 1989, and in the \"global game\" literature, to provide a better framework for *design* of an improved anchor."

    "### III - Inflation and lower neutral rates - an allocation problem of imbalances and shortages among countries (in trade, consumption and financing)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start first with **a most basic allocation scheme of N assets between N agents (or countries - the two terms will be used interchangeably in the rest of this notebook)**, that of Bogolmonaia and Moulin (2001)'s cake-eating game, which we will progressively complexify and merge with standard open macroeconomy models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, in the broad \"money vs goods\" balance à la John Stuart Mill, any imbalance can also be viewed as a shortage of one of these sides. ***Allocating*** these shortages during times of imbalances is thus the key in evaluating how lower neutral rates (shortage of safe assets) or inflation (shortage of goods) occur and spread between countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the description of agents' actions in Bogolmonaia and Moulin (2001)'s cake-eating game **provides close analogy on how safety considerations are being carried out dynamically in time, along with risk vs returns logics, by central bank officers**. That analogy sustains the practicality of use and predictive power of our model, which can thus also serve as foundation and complement of existing models such as Mundell-Fleming, **by enabling calibration of practical values and of curves slopes in highly stylized model such as the Safe Asset Scarcity and Aggregate Demand version of IS/LM developed by Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas (AER, 2016)**. Indeed, the slope of the AS curve can be derived from the amount of inflationary pressure computed by our model (through the allocation of a shortage of goods among countries) and the slope of the AD curve can be derived from the amount of pressure on interest rates computed by our model (through the allocation of a shortage of safe asset among countries).  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Before seeing how our model unfolds, let's first describe the original Bogolmonaia and Moulin \"cake eating\" allocation game. We will then show how to extend it to a dynamic model of inflation and interest rate trands.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Their original paper provides a \"natural constructive algorithm\" which characterizes the entire set of ordinally efficient assignments. Ordinal efficiency is a notion they defined, in between ex post efficiency - ordinal efficiency being stronger - and  ex ante efficiency - ordinal efficiency being weaker. An *assignment problem* being an allocation problem where N objects (the \"cakes\") are to be allocated among N agents (the \"mices\"), and each agent is to receive exactly one object (we will relax that last constraint in our extension).\n",
    "\n",
    "Their constructuive algorithm (the \"cake eating) works as follow: *think of each object as 1 unit of an infinitely divisible commodity - or \"cake\" (a different commodity for each object). Each agent now is given an exogeneous eating speed function, specifying a rate of instant consumption for each time t between 0 and 1, and such that the integral of each function is 1. Given a profile of preferences (over sure objects), the algorithm works as follows: **each agent eats from his or her best *available* object at the given speed**, where an object is available at time t if and only if less than one unit has been eaten away up to time t by all agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "This solution (called probabilistic serial) is a central point in the set of ordinally efficient assignments; indeed **if we choose the eating speeds independent of the preference profiles (which we will in our extension), the probabilistic serial assignment is the only equitable one** (similarly, random priority assignment is a central point within the set of ex post efficient assignments). We will explore further the mechanism design properties and comparisons of their allocation game in Part 2, but let's now explore first how we extend it to a monetary model.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB : *Ordinal efficiency means that we only consider mechanisms that elicits only individual preferences over sure objects ordinal (whereas a cardinal mechanism collects a full-fledged Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function from every agent). The restriction to ordinal mechanisms is the central assumption in their paper. As they put it, \"it can be justified by the limited rationality of the agents participating in the mechanism. There is convincing experimental evidence that the representation of preferences over uncertain outcomes by VNM utility functions is inadequate (see, e.g., Kagel and Roth [11]). One interpretation of this literature is that the formulation of rational preferences over a given set of lotteries is a complex process that most agents do not engage into if they can avoid it. An ordinal mechanism allows the participants to formulate only this part of their preferences that does not require to think about the choice over lotteries. It is genuinely simpler to implement an ordinal mechanism than a cardinal one\".*\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be linked to the discussion of countries in our model behaving in a (mostly) non-strategic fashion. We will discuss that in the end of the next paragraph, in which we examine in detail the approximations and assumptions we are making in our modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "--\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Let's see now how such a one-round game can be extended into a multiround game, and what properties and incentives will such an extension present.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If agents are countries (we will from here onward use the two terms interchangeably) condemned to interact with each other for eternity (at least by the standards of our individual lives), we will thus play the previous game on an infinite number of rounds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each round would unfold as described just above in the original Bogolmonaia and Moulin scheme. However, as in history, the outputs of each round impacts the inputs of the next. To record that we will use an endowment/consumption matrix, for each agent to store the pieces of cakes he ate during a round, and carry it on to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for round T, the allocation algorithm follows that of Bogolmonaia and Moulin (2001) described just above. Each country i (out of N) - the \"mouse i\" - simultaneously absorb each others' cakes $\\zeta_j,_T$, with j$\\in$[1,N] at different absorption speed ($\\omega_i,_T$ for country i), and each one following its own preference ranking $P_i,_T$. While $\\zeta_j,_T$ $\\in$ $\\Bbb R_{>=0}$ and $\\omega_i,_T$ $\\in$ $\\Bbb R_{>=0}$, $P_i,_T$ is a 1xN matrix  which contains a single time every integer between [1,..N]. **When a cake by one country is finished the countries j that were eating it move to the item below in their rankings matrices $P_j,_T$**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent stores what he absorbed during the round in that agent's aggregated reserves, which is formalized through the consumption matrix. **The state of the world at the end of each round T can thus be represented by one NxN consumption matrix $E_T$**, which records how much cakes in total each agent has generated up to round T, and which agent are holding which proportion of these cakes. For convention we can fix column j of this matrix as all the cakes issued by agent j AND absorbed by agent i (in line i of this matrix). Cell (i,j) hence denotes the size of the cake issued by agent j that agent i absorbed into its own reserve.  \n",

    "And we have the relation, to denote the fact that column j of $E_T$ represents all the different shares of the cake $\\zeta_j,_T$ issued by agent j at round T, absorbed by all agents i (**if $\\zeta_j,_T$ has been totally absorbed during round T - which is not necessarily the case.

    "#### A quick mathematical view of the incentives introduced by the repeatition of the game :\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now look only at the dynamic process, without caring about how the inner mechanism within a round works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define $D^i_t$ as the cake generated by country i at round t and $\\bar{D}_t$ the average cake size accross all agents at t. So using the previous notations with the endowment/consumption matrix, $D^i_t = \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^N (c_i,_j,_T )$  and $\\bar{D}^i_t =$ average($\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^N (c_i,_j,_T )$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also define $\\gamma^i_t$ as country i's average ranking and the average eating speed of the countries which ranked i highly (so the ones most likely to eat country i's cake during this round t), over all countries' average ranking and average eating speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, by defining $S^i_t$ =  $D^i_t/\\bar{D}_t$, we thus have, through the terms we just defined (and if we accept the assumption that cake size has something to do with how much other countries are willing to accept it) the growth equation of our dynamic system $S^i_{t+1}$ = $\\gamma^i_{t+1}.S^i_t$ \n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's recall Gabaix (2009)'s proof that **one would only need to assume that the growth rates $\\gamma^i_t$ are i.i.d. random variables to give a resulting power law distribution** (with the existance of the steady-state distribution guaranteed by frictions that both prevents small countries from becoming too small and a lower bound for sizes enforced by a reflecting barrier - for instance a fixed cost that prevents anyone to start a very small country). \n",
    "\n",
    "- In our case it is sure that these growth rates $\\gamma^i_t$ introduce *increased* inequalities, because of safety as a positive feedback loop. Indeed, by repeating such a game with a large number of countries integrate the notion of \"safety\", which brings here a positive feedback loop. A country that doesn't default in the past will be perceived as safer, so would be ranked higher, hence will indeed become safer (and thus could issue bigger debts at each round). Then the resulting distribution would be even more *inequal* than the power laws obtained just above.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this is **to give a quick intuition of how through our model the distribution of cake sizes will be at least *power law imbalanced*. Hence huge incentives introduced, to strategically game the system and improve one's ranking by other agents**. This can be related to some conclusions from the He et al. AER 2020 paper, in which countries strategically optimize their issuance \"to capture a safety premium\" (we will examine this conclusion further in our analysis). This can also be linked to how a winner-takes-all reserve currency can account for a larger and larger share of the global economy's reserve, due to its \"safety\" advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's now examine other trends that arise from such a modelling, notably that concerning interest rates and inflation. Once all these have been explored, we will come back to the axiomatic approach to re-define strategic proofness, ordinal efficiency and cardinal efficiency in the context of this exact model, to provide a framework for design of improvements to the current international monetary system.\n",

    "### IV - The linkage from this multiround shortage allocation game to a dynamic model of inflation and interest rate trends\n",
    "\n",
    "For our extension of the \"cake eating\" model let's specify what the N objects that are to be allocated to the N agents are, what the eating speed functions are, what determines each agent's preference ordering, and how the outputs of one round of this game influences the inputs of the next (**the goal of our model being to enable a multiround, multiagent formulation of the monetary system**). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **What the N objects that are to be allocated between the N countries are:**\n",

    "Because shortages on one side or the other of the broad \"money vs goods' balance can be viewed as symmetric, a single allocation model of any shortage on one side of the balance (ie any surplus on the other side of the balance) should both be able to explain inflation trends *and* interest rate trends. Hence, the only \"asset\" (the \"cake\" in Bogolmonaia and Moulin (2001)'s cake-eating game) whose allocation we will be modelling could be described using the concept of \"purchasing power\" - which quantifies the state of the balance between money (a nation's currency) and goods at a given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fiat monetary anchoring, we can define **each national currency's \"purchasing power as the amount of it which trading partners accepts to receive and keep in reserve\"** (*here we can recall Schacht's analysis of \"the war of 1914, which provided telling proof of the fact that state-guaranteed paper money, unlike gold and silver coins, does not represent any substantial value [...]. The war of 1914 isolated Germany from the greater part of the world market.  The Mark had become unusable on enemy markets. It has lost its purchasing power\". (Schacht, *The Magic of Money*, p94*). Hence our model of the international monetary system, which consists in just countries. Each of these countries prints fiat money, which has to be accepted by others in order for it to have any purchasing power. \n",
    "\n",
    "And, now that this purchasing power that we are allocating have been define, let's examine the two sides of the imbalance it can find itself caught in :\n",
    "   - **in a safe asset shortage environment** - in which there is an excess of good being produced compared to the available quantities of safe assets - each country can be represented by a \"mice (the country's aggregated investors and consumers - ie its financial investment capacity in a monetary language, or its consumption capacity in a goods language), which absorbs the \"cakes\" (countries' liabilities - ie their industrial investment needs in a monetary language, or their production capacity in a goods language) generated by himself and by other countries. The liability side here can also more simply be viewed as bonds, link to the He et al. (2015) model of safe asset pricing. It can also be linked to the view of the US as \"the world's banker\",as in Despres, Kindleberger and Salant 1966.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   In that case, **inflation can first be seen as just the corollary of devaluations** (a country that fails to see its monetary funding needs met, ie a country that failed to have its \"cake\" entirely eaten at the end of a round, devalues. It thus sees the prices of goods imported increase - hence inflation). For an easier mental picture here, since there is an excess of goods being produced in this environment, we would just assume that all goods are imported, from a fictional third party supplier of goods not playing the game - which is made possible by the normalization of our game to an unique unit of account). **So a devaluation in one's currency would automatically lead to a rise of prices in that country.**  \n",

Think of Russia selling off US Treasury bonds in the aftermath of the 2008 Financial crisis, to add panic maybe). However the world has been mostly peaceful for the past 30 years, so this type of \"weaponization\" of countries' eating order has been mostly marginal.   \n",

    "    \n",
    "- 2) The second outcome of manipulation would be to allow countries who would otherwise have failed to unload all of their cake unload it successfully, hence providing them some funding (and inflationary) relief which would not correspond to fundamentals. A lighter version of that - let's call it 2)bis - would be to encourage a country to issue more debt than it should have, \"for its own good\". This could be motivated by development and industrial policy motives - one could for instance think about China funding the US debt to incentivize the latter to consume and invest more in the prior's production capacities and technologies, even as some American companies or workers suffer from this new competition. However, this motive closer to the political economy sphere has not usually been taken too much into account by monetary theorists and tenants of free markets, which could explain why most (non-Asian) countries don't try to manipulate so much in such a fashion.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "For now let's assume that countries do not manipulate then (we will come back on that assumption in Part 3, when concerning ourselves with the design of a strategy-proof system). Indeed if we make the approximation that the number of countries manipulating their ordering following \"weaponized\" motives (as in 1), or following industrialization motives (as in 2) are low, we can then assume that the countries only follow aims of maximizing the value of their endowment matrices, and this only round by round (ie they are not trying to predict over the long run which countries' currencies will appreciate in the long run, nor which countries debt will be more likely to default in the long run). \n",
    "\n",

    "Countries' behaviours can then be \"coded\" following a set of criteria, which will also allow us to see **what long-term 'natural' tendencies come out of this game**. We postulate that in real life most private investors like asset managers don't think about the 'global game' consequences à la He et al., AER 2020, except in an Instability zone à la Farhi, Maggiori, QJE 2018.\n",

    "Indeed, uncertainty about both other players' private preferences and about future events limit their capacity to be more strategic than looking at safety, through the \"history\" of in what proportion of time did a country successfully unloaded all his cake, from round 1 until the current round. The case in which players' don't have access to others' private preferences and estimations corresponds in fact in  He et al., AER 2020 to \"the case where investor-j is almost sure that fundamentals are δ0, but is unsure about what other investors know, and whether other investors know that investor-j knows fundamentals are δ0. If δ0 > δ∗ then country 1 debt is the safe asset, while if δ0 < δ∗ then country 2 debt is the safe asset. Given that all investors know almost surely the value of δ0, investors are then almost sure which debt is safe. Mapping this interpretation to thinking about the world, the model says today may be a day that US Treasury bonds are almost surely safe, i.e., δ0 ≫ δ∗\".\n",

    "Furthermore, we could also add here the observation that fund managers benchmarked on credit indexes with relative notional weighting - so linked to the outstanding debt, such as Barclays Agg, or tracking them, often have to follow the evolution of the bigger weights within this index, who if they issue more debt will also automatically have more of their debt being acquired by managers tracking indexes, since their share within the index will have increased.\n",
    "\n",

Indeed, we add the deterministic rule that, after some random initialization of countries' initial interest rate at round 1, at each round that a country succeeds in unloading all of its cake it will lower the interest it promises debt holders, whereas at each round that a country fails to unload all of its cake and suffers devaluation he will raise this interest rate, to make his debt more attractive. \n",

    "**Finally, we introduces a qualitative \"alliance graph\", called trading_preferences below, to allow for exogeneous preferences of some countries for others**. This will also enable us to model in Part 2 shifts in trade environment, or to implement the manipulation à la 2)bis defined above.
