    "- Time is discrete, in rounds.\n",
    "- At the start of each round each country generates one \"cake\" (debt) \n",
    "- Each country simultaneously eats each others' cakes (debt) at different speed and following different rankings (so when a piece of cake is finished the countries that were eating eat move to the item below in their rankings)\n",
    "- Each country stores what he ate in his reserves - the endowments\n",
    "- If at the end of a round a country's cake has not been completed absorbed (by itself and/or by other countries) it suffers a devaluation - i.e. every the value of pieces of cake from this country store in others' endowments is decreased, and its interest rate rises.\n",
    "- Countries' ranking preferences are function of their trading preferences, their trading partners' debts' \"safety\", interest rate, size, and some randomness. See in more details below on how rankings and cakes are generated by each country at each round, and on how endowments change according to countries' behaviours.\n",

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "We present here the detailed code used for the simulations. For that we first calibrate the model to match the main trends and events observed from 1945 to now (2020). Being able to capture these features of past history will provide confidence and intuition in the model's inner workings. That lead us to provide several scenarii in how the models' parameters will change following Covid-19's increase in debts *(these parameters from the model being for instance the change in debt levels, while debt absorption speed are maintained roughly constant. Different degrees in shifts in trade and supply chain preferences are also considered)*. We thus generate 50 more rounds after a common departing point, and report here the different outcomes, and the different probabilities of each outcome (since they are intervention of random perturbations in the model the probabilities of each outcome is calculated based on how many of different random sequence generate this specific outcome).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulations of extra Covid debts show that :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **in the case of everything constant (pre Trump US and China trade relations)** debts are overall sustainable, with adjustements in reserve levels and contraction of countries' economies depending on how affected by the crisis they were.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Screen%20Shot%202020-04-06%20at%2010.05.35%20AM.png\" /> \n",
    "\n",
    "- **similar results in the case of everything constant, with just additional reliance on trade with China** (for instance for masks, medical supplies etc). The economic contraction is smaller, and the global reserve contraction as well. This could be interpreted by the fact that the additional trade with China is flushed in its reserve (the increase can be seen in the graph below), used to acquire other countries' debt (inferred from the lowering of global interest rates) and thus sustaining economic activity \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Screen%20Shot%202020-04-06%20at%2011.13.15%20AM.png\" /> \n",
    "\n",
    "- **in the case of everything constant among all countries except China and US, who in that scenario stop trading with each other**, they are small probabilities of a global contraction (less reserves, less debts, less GDP growth) that preserves the overall shares of each country in the global economy - except for China in the global economy which suffers more. However in these small probability event the US go through an initial bubble fueled by the decrease of China, that then collapses back to the initial level (and note that after this collapse China's share is also back to the initial level - but with the cost of a global contraction, especially for all EM markets). **And with the caveat provided just above that this debt model doesn't take into account other incentives and consequences created by such dynamics - small probabilities in economic contraction in one country might leading to escalating tensions on other dimensions as well*\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Screen%20Shot%202020-04-04%20at%209.50.20%20PM.png\" /> \n",
    "\n",
    "- **in the case of stopping trade between China and the US AND additional reliance by other countries on China**, there is high probability for a sudden takeover of the role of the US as reserve currency China, accompanied by strong contraction for every other country. **Again, with the previous caveat of unaccounted destabilizing geopolitical consequences**\n",

    "\n",
    "- **finally, in the case of our proposed stabilization scheme** *(details in the paper - in the model it is just reflected as more willingness from participating countries to accept others' devaluation - see the commented code in the last cells of this notebook. Un-implemented here is also the extra information each country will have on how much latitude they will have at each round on their debt, which should also help in addition of the effects produced here to stabilize debts, interest rates and balance global reserve currencies)* the effects of all above scenarii are smoothen, with much more balanced reserve currencies (at least 3 currencies accounting each more than 20% of the global share of reserves, with the exact currencies - most often Germany ie the Euro, or the JPY - switching depending on the random shocks, but without adverse effects on all countries - including on the US even though the dollar loses its monopoly as reserve currency)\n",

    "### A quick review of our stabilization scheme :\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of our proposal resides the *multi-currency* nature of the market making activity of international banks, which we aim at replicating at a central bank level. A first underlying reason would be that of *collection of risk* - in the line of bigger risks for higher returns. Additionally (and that is a second reason for emphasizing the multi-currency aspect) in our case the additional risk is that of adding on more exotic currencies such as the South East Asian ones in a reserve basket previously not containing them - that could thus act as an additional cushion to mitigate external shock on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is then possible to see that for such a **multi-currency reserve balance sheet** the profit objective of traditional private market maker is here also aligned with the volatility stabilization objective of the central banks involved, and that the mechanisms underlying these forms of interventions would be conceptually the same as the ones through which financiers' alterations to their balance sheets affect both the level and volatility of exchange rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design question then, critical to the feasibility of such a multi-exotic ASEAN currencies account for instance, is on **how to create and foster this form of collaboration among different central banks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computing these multilateral balance sheets, through privacy-preserving methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy-preserving methods like multiparty computation *(referring to the financial adaptation of Abbe, Khandani, Lo, 2012, which build on Yao 1982; Goldreich, Micali, and Wigderson 1987; Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and Wigderson 1988; Chaum, Crépeau, and Damgard 1988; Beaver, Micali, and Rogaway\n",
    "1990; Cramer et al. 1999)* provide a clear and useful framework on which to **reach agreement on the different exchange and interest rate objectives pursued by respective central banks**. This is why this section will build on the language and framework of these privacy-preserving methods - which again don't have to be *actually* implemented for the interventions to be conducted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine indeed how different central banks would proceed to build such a common balance sheet, and conduct market making operations. They would first each allocate some funds denominated in their national currencies, plus portions of their reserves in each of the currencies they would like to stabilize their exchange rates with. They would then set-up the daily volatility bands they want their national currencies to stay in, which proportion of reserves they are ready to commit to the operation, and what amount of risk or leverage they are ready to bear on any derivative instrument used in the process (for convenience let's imagine the updates are only feasible at a regular interval - for instance once a day or once a week. We are then in a discreet time setting). These three points are where privacy-preserving methods might be applied, since participant central banks wouldn't want for instance *the entirety* of the reserves they engaged in that fund to be potentially used to defend the currency of another participating country - thus a daily total amount of reserves committed to each currency could be computed for instance using the aforementioned methods, without individual inputs from each central bank being revealed). Note that the viewing of the results of these computations can also be restrained so that each central bank only sees the pooling of reserves allocated to him - and not that allocated to others. In this fashion, both inputs and outputs of these forms of computations have modular privacy settings, that can be deployed according to participants preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous paragraph described mostly a pooling of reserves, quite similar to what already exists in the Chiang Mai Initiative, but applied on a continuous and systematic basis rather than just during times of extreme stress (in fact one of the goals of this automatic and systematic market smoothing is to potentially provide in-commensurable psychological relief and precious time for governments to *avoid* times of extreme stress). However there are other benefits to having a common multicurrency account: first, the mechanisms derived to stabilize a currency vs the international currencies part of the reserves portfolio can now also be used to also stabilize more exotic currency pairs (but among natural trading partners) such as the MYR/IDR, to avoid the flash-crash like features presented below (fetch from Google on October 10th, 2019 - the pikes are probably coming from data collection related issues on Google's side, illustrating even further the array of challenges raised by the Correspondant Banking System for FX markets, especially on emerging market currencies). Furthermore, our scheme would constitute an implementation of the \"optimal capital controls, that should lean against the wind by requiring a temporary tax on inflows and a subsidy on outflows (if dealing with sudden inflows, the opposite if dealing with a sudden stop)\" from Farhi and Werning (2013).helps including more currencies in the global reserve distribution, and \n",

    "### Caveat and limitations from the model\n",
    "\n",
    "As every model our is incomplete, and it is important to keep the hypothesis and missings in mind when interpreting its results. Among the many limitations of this model the most important ones are that we use :\n",
    "\n",
    "- no utility functions, so countries' only drivers here is the obligation to absorb imbalances generated randomly (or through trade)\n",
    "- no military perspective, everything is purely in the economic sphere (but one could easily think how military intervention could be employed to prevent economic changes)\n",
    "- no legacy from a round to another beyond changes in endowments i.e. accumulated reserves from countries' debts. So we think of no soft power, no cultural dominance, and no psychological or sociological drivers (think of white supremacists - unaccounted for in our model)\n",
    "- no micro behaviours that can change macro decisions (so no Cambridge Analytica types shifting institutions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of how our hypothesis crucially relies on countries' economic rationality, we also explore in our paper how rational situations can lead countries to invest in military expenditures and interventions (for instance in the case of an unwanted reserve currency monopoly other countries might be driven to invest in military to \"force\" a shift in reserve currency. This is also one of the reason why we consider a truly multipolar reserve stabilization scheme - as for us only a truly balanced reserve composition can lead countries to compete fully on economic terms with less incentive to wage war. Of course that idealistic view has to be balanced with the imperatives of electoralist pressure, of nationalism and of cultural differences).\n",

The reason we chose this one was that given initial conditions close to that of 1945 in debt repartition and trade preferences, and given the Marshall plan, the Germany forgiveness and the Korean war stimulus to Japan, it would give with high frequency approximately correct share of reserves and GDP (using \"absorption speed\" as proxy) now (with high frequency referring to the random initialization - as here we have \"correct\" contemporary outputs more than 80% of the times with random initialization in 1945 and hard coded shocks after).\n",
